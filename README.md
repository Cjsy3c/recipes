I wanted to build a recipe book for personal use but there are so many technologies out there and existing sites. I really wanted something I could get versioned backups of so that I can view all changes. By using a git repository, I get the versioning and I can use github or gitlab to display the markdown files.

This is a personal recipe cook book. All recipes are just basic markdown files and you will find no long backstories before you can get to the recipe.

Pull requests are welcome.
